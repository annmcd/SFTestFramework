**Security Settings**

# What are Salesforce Security Settings?

A users security settings determine;
- What Features they have access to
- What Records they have access to

A users security settings are based on a combination of;

- Roles,
- Profiles,
- PermissionSets,
- Sharing Rules
- Public Groups

Note: The minimum combination is Org Wide Defaults, Role & Profile

**Test Scope**
